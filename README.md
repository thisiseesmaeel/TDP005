# TDP005 - Project: Object Oriented System

The course is the second project course for education in innovative programming. In this course, students are still working in pairs, this time to build a game in C++. The course is running parallel to the course in object-oriented programming, where students are learning C++.

The course includes four consecutive moments:

Introduction to software development methods (software engineering)
